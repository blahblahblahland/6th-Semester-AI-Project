# 6th-Semester-AI-Project
Completely coded in Python, using pandas, sklearn.linear_model and mathplotlib.pyplot libraries.
Using a csv file we first load up the data, then split and save it. 
That data is then used in a Linear Regression Model, the first five columns as X, the last as Y.
We use this data to find 6 parameters and then visualize the actual vs predicted values on a graph.
